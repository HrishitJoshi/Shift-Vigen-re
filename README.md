# Shift-Vigen-re

 Coded Shift and Vigenère ciphers in python and performed a successful index of Coincidence (IC) attacks on both the ciphers
 

problem_1() - Normal Shift Cipher

problem_2() - Normal Shift Cipher without employing the "decrypt" function

problem_3() - Brute Force attack on the Shift Cipher

problem_4() - Indec of Coincidence Attack on the Shift Cipher

problem_6() - Vigenère Cipher

problem_7a() - Index of Coincidence attack on the Vigenère ciphertext to find the key length

problem_7b() - After getting the key length, another IC attack for getting the plain text.
